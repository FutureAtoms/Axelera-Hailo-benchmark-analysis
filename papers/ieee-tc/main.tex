\begin{abstract}
We present comprehensive benchmark results comparing leading edge AI accelerators through rigorous hardware evaluation. Our systematic testing of Axelera AI Metis hardware with 1,199 real measurements reveals significant performance characteristics: peak throughput of 6,829.2 FPS on ResNet-18, power efficiency of 228.26 FPS/W, and 79.9\% multi-core scaling efficiency across four cores. Comparative analysis with Hailo-8 specifications shows distinct performance trade-offs: Axelera demonstrates 5.7× higher peak throughput (6,829.2 vs 1,200 FPS estimated), while both platforms offer comparable power efficiency in their respective operating ranges. Statistical validation with 95\% confidence intervals confirms measurement reliability (CV < 20\% for all metrics). Our evaluation addresses gaps in current benchmarking practices through large-scale empirical measurement and provides quantitative performance data essential for informed hardware selection in edge AI applications. The complete dataset and reproducible methodology are provided to enable independent validation and extension.

\section{Introduction}

The rapid growth of edge AI applications has created critical demand for reliable performance data to guide hardware selection decisions. Current AI accelerator evaluations often rely on limited measurements and manufacturer specifications, making direct performance comparison challenging for system designers and researchers.

This paper presents comprehensive benchmark results from systematic hardware evaluation of leading edge AI accelerators. Our primary contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive hardware benchmarks}: 1,199 real measurements across multiple configurations on Axelera AI Metis platform
    \item \textbf{Performance characterization}: Detailed analysis of throughput, latency, power consumption, and multi-core scaling
    \item \textbf{Comparative analysis}: Quantified performance trade-offs between Axelera Metis and Hailo-8 platforms
    \item \textbf{Statistical validation}: Confidence intervals and reproducibility analysis to ensure measurement reliability
\end{enumerate}

Our evaluation focuses on CNN workloads representative of edge AI applications, using ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 models on real hardware under controlled conditions. The results provide quantitative performance data essential for hardware selection in edge AI deployments.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{AI Accelerator Benchmarking}

Recent hardware evaluation studies have examined various AI accelerator platforms~\cite{benchmarking_edge2024}. MLPerf benchmarks provide standardized workloads for machine learning performance evaluation, though implementation varies across different hardware platforms~\cite{isca_benchmark2020}.

Survey papers document the diversity of edge AI accelerator architectures and their respective advantages~\cite{optimization_survey2025}. However, direct performance comparisons between specific hardware platforms remain limited in the literature.
